Visualizing Normalized Data

This project uses data exported from Trading View to illustrate what can be done by normalizing data before visualizing it.

A regression line and moving averages are included because they are believed to be helpful technical analysis tools.

The visualization method is Plotly.  

The attributes and colors chosen are arbitrary for this exploration.  The intent here is to create a context for evaluating financial market data using statistical methods and visualization tools.  Future explorations may expand on this by evaluating the attributes created here using machine learning models, or by recognizing relationships between attributes that seem to have predictive value when plotted together.
